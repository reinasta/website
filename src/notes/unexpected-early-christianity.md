# History

The critical-historical method amounts to a reading of
the biblical texts that takes into account that these
texts were written, interpreted and addressed to humans
with all the parochial intentions, biases, fears and
social constraints that humans unavoidably are caught in.
This is no denial of the metaphysical reality of what
is asserted in the bible, since the historical concern is 
with how such realities are conceived and passed on.

In applying the critical-historical method, we have to consider
each of the biblical texts on its own and note both the
similarities and differences with the other books of the
Bible. The alternative approach is to try to harmonize
the different biblical texts, thus missing historical
information about the individuals that communicated by
these textual means and their societies.

Another way of falsifying the historical context of the
biblical texts is to read them allegorically in order to
satisfy this or that theological desideratum. This, a
good historian cannot do. For people do not speak in
allegories all the time and when they do they have
special reasons for it and signal this to their audiences.

The biblical texts were written at different times and
for different communities. Jesus died around 30 CE. (From
now on all dates refer to the common era, CE.) Paul started 
writing his letters in the 50s, so about 20 years after Jesus
died and without having met Jesus. The gospels were written
even later: Mark between 65-70, Luke and Matthew between
80-85 and John after 95, perhaps at the beginning of the
second century.

At the time of their writing, these texts were not part of
the Christian canon, because there was *no* Christian canon.
At most we can talk of many Christianities if we take into 
account that the Jesus movement was a sect within Judaism 
and the adepts of this sect tried to make sense of Jesus's 
teachings and his tragic death. In so doing they pulled in 
different doctrinal directions.
Differences between these writings is what we should expect.
Information about Jesus -- his deeds and sayings -- was 
carried through oral traditions.
Jesus and his followers spoke Aramaic, a different language 
than the  one the early Christian texts were written in, 
namely Ancient Greek.
The authors of these texts were scattered throughout the
Mediterranean world, in places very remote from Jesus's
Palestine.
It would have been a miracle for all these texts -- written
by different people in a different language in different
corners of the Mediterranean world -- to come upon the very
same set of theological theses.


# Society

We don't know very much about the identity of the gospel
writers, but we can be pretty sure that they were not the
immediate followers of Jesus -- his twelve apostles.
If the timeline that most scholars agree on is correct, we can
see that the first gospel was written at least 30 years after
Jesus's death.
Leaving aside the very low life expectancy in the antiquity,
which makes it probable that the apostles were dead by the
60s, most of the ancient people were illiterate. Only ten
percent of the people had education and these were the upper
class and even those may not have been able to write at the
high level of language that the gospels exhibit.
Jesus's apostles, as Jesus himself, were Palestinian fishermen 
peasants or handymen. It would be surprising to find out that
such toilers would have been able to write in their own language
(Aramaic), let alone Greek.

Jesus was born in a world dominated by the Roman empire.
He came from Galilee in Palestine, a territory that, like
so many others in the Mediterranean region,
had already a Roman administration in place. The prestige
language was Ancient Greek, and this was the language that
the Roman elites and administrators used. That this language
was Greek and not Latin is due to the perceived superiority
of the Greek culture and the Romans admiration for it.

The Romans granted all its colonies freedom of religion as long 
as this did not interfere with their political authority and the 
extraction of taxes.

The Romans populated their colonies with Roman citizens, including
imperial officials. The main social unit of the Greco-Roman world
in the East was the so-called *familia*. Despite its familiar
sounding name, *familia* was more akin to the notion of household
than to that of nuclear family. For the *familia* included many
kinds of people beyond the parents and the children. It included
three generations, at least as long as the grandparents were alive.
Is often included the families of the sons, who might bring
their wives in the parental house. Yet, *familia* is even broader
than the extended family as it included slaves as well as freed man, 
lodgers and other 'clients'. 

The slaves took care of the physical work, looked after children 
and could also act as secretaries and business managers. 
In many cases, the slaves who proved talented would be freed in order 
to take care of the family business, since otherwise slaves were not 
able to sign contracts. 
Hence the category of *freed* people. The freed people 
were not entirely free, as they still owed the household duties. 
Freed people were clients. Clients were all the people who would work 
for the household in exchange for patronage, and included, apart from 
freed people, lodgers and other individuals who contributed work to the
household.

All these people belonging to a household need not reside in the
same place. A freed man managing one of the household businesses
may well represent the household at some other location. Then
sometimes newly weds would live in their own house, although they
still belonged legally to their own households (or to the husband's
household depending on the specific legal arrangements with the
household of the wife^[Cf. Shaw 1987 and Radford Ruether 13ff]).

The Greco-Roman household was strictly hierarchical. 
^[Most of these hierarchical household relations were inscribed 
in the law but it was not unusual that households involve informal 
arrangements and relations that departed from the letter of the law. 
See Martin 45ff for more details]
At the top of the hierarchy was the oldest male, the *pater 
familias*. Then there were the adult male offspring, followed 
by the women and children. Further down the hierarchy were the 
freed persons and the slaves. 
This hierarchy always placed males above females: fathers above
mothers, sons above daughters, and freed men above freed women.
It also underpinned most of the rights of people: in case of
legal disputes, the wives stood no chance against their husbands,
and the freed man would have certainly lost against their
patrons. (The imperial ideology is that those who have more
-- are richer, more powerful, have higher status -- are more
honest because they have fewer incentives to cheat than those
who did not have as much.)

As we will see, the Roman household is intimately
connected to the development of early Christianity.

# Authenticity

We have already alluded to the existence of different early
Christianities.
This plurality can be sometimes masked -- but only shallowly
so -- by another practice common to the Greco-Roman world:
forgery. Authors were writing texts in the name of their more 
famous peers. They were doing it for money (to sell the writings
to a library owner), out of modesty (to show deference for
a highly esteemed author), or in order to reach a wider audience
(as more people would read texts by a famous author).
For most people, it was quite difficult to check the authenticity
of writings, since information circulated slowly and most
people were illiterate. 

Nowhere is the problem of forgery more significant then in
the case of Paul's writings. If the gospels were not signed
(their titles being later, fourth century additions), most of the
biblical texts attributed to Paul are signed. Yet not all
are Paul's. We can work this out by ourselves by a close
reading of the texts. In the next two sections I will discuss
the different views of family that two Pauline letters put
forward.

# The real Paul

Paul approaches the topic of marriage by speaking of sexuality.
Since Paul assumed a view common in the Jewish and Roman worlds 
that sex outside marriage was immoral, his discussion of 
sexuality entails a certain attitude towards marriage and family.

Paul recommends sexual intercourse as a way of gaining control
over one's sexuality for those who do not already possess
self-control. Paul is clear, though, that it's preferable to
be chaste (even within marriage) if one's self-control allows.
Remarkably, Paul requires self-control not because he wants to
bar the sexual act itself. On the contrary, he states that sexual 
intercourse is enhancing one's control. What's essential for Paul 
is that one does not feel sexual desire -- a common view in the Roman
world. 

It seems to follow that one may have as much sex as one wants
-- within marriage -- as long as this is conducted dispassionately.
Paul would probably object that this would give too much time to 
the insignificant matter of sexuality. For Paul, as for other
apocalyptic preachers of the first century (Jesus being the most
famous example), one should focus one's mind on the Kingdom of God. 
Preoccupation with the family -- not only sexual intercourse but 
also all the other family needs -- should be subordinate to 
preparing ourselves and our fellows to enter the Kingdom of God. 
To do that we need to learn to love one another. 
This leaves little time for families. Concerns with
procreation and children are conspicuously absent in Paul's remarks
about the family, although they were one of the key focus in both 
Jewish and more generally Roman cultures. That makes sense only
if we remember that Paul was expecting Jesus' second coming during
his life time.

Paul's apocalyptic view as well as his then-common hostility to 
sexual desire make him rank celibate life above a married life
and chastity above sexual activity.



# The pro-household Paul

The pastoral epistles -- 1 and 2 Timothy, and Titus -- are
called 'pastoral' because their authors were addressing leaders 
(or pastors) of early Christian churches.
These letters are sufficiently similar in content to treat them
as a whole. 
They are about how a church should be organized.

If we took these letters at face value, we would have to conclude
that they were written by Paul and addressed to two of his
disciples, Timothy and Titus. These letters start with the
author identifying himself as Paul, in a rather characteristic
fashion. Yet, as historians point out, it is unlikely that Paul
wrote these texts.

For one thing, the letters mention church offices -- bishop and
presbyter -- that did not exist in the middle of the first
century when Paul was active. When Paul was setting up his
churches and writing letters to their communities, no clear
hierarchical structure was in place, and Paul's uncontested
letters testify to that. So I will follow the common historical
assumption that the pastoral letters were written at the
beginning of the second century and were addressed to third
generation disciples of Paul.

Although these letters are concerned with church organization,
we can distill from them the picture of the family with which
the authors work. This is no other than the patriarchal view
of the family.

In 1 Timothy, the authors takes issue with a Christian tradition
that taught abstinence: refraining from rich foods and from
marriage. According to this author, foods and spouses are goods
to be enjoyed, since if they existed at all it was because
God made them available to us and considered them good (within 
limits).

The authors of the pastoral epistles model the church after
the Roman family. The bishop is to be a most respectable
*paterfamilias* -- the head of the church-household. The
deacon should also be selected from exemplary paterfamilias.

It is well known that in the Roman households, women had to
submit to their husbands. Accordingly, the author forbids
women to speak in church. 

This attitude to women might seem similar to Paul's, since
the prohibition of women's speech is an echo of a similar
remark in 1 Corinthians. Yet, it may be that Paul's later
disciples tampered with his text. Bart Ehrman submits that
the prohibition of women's speech in church is a later
insertion made by someone other than Paul. This is because,
Ehrman argues, the infamous passage appears in slightly
different places -- as if they had been shuffled around
with the neighboring sentences -- in chapter 14 of 1
Corinthians, which suggests that it originated as a margin
note, (ii) some manuscripts do not include the passage at
all, and (iii) Paul says precisely the opposite a few
paragraphs earlier (in 1 Corinthians 11).

Be that as it may, the attitude towards women displayed by
the pastoral epistles is different from that shown by Paul
in his letters. All egalitarian nuances specific to Paul's
message -- 'in Christ there is not male and female, master
and slave' -- disappear in the pastoral epistles. Paul shows 
respect for his female collaborators. He is the only
early Christian writer to call a woman an apostle. He also
mentions women deacons. Paul, at least according to some
of his writings, is okay with women praying and prophesying
(and thus speaking) in church.

In contrast, the pastoral epistles take the traditional
gender relations and re-instate them within the church.
Since the church according to the pastoral letters borrows
its structure from the Roman household, every member of
the latter -- the wife, children, slaves, the widow etc -- 
take a similar position in the church.


# The anti-household Paul

The *Acts of Paul and Thecla* is modeled after the Greco-Roman
romance.
Two young, attractive individuals -- a man and a woman -- briefly
meet and fall in love. Barely have they the chance to know each
other that hostile people and unfavorable circumstances interfere.
The narrative's ups and downs are part of a quest for the young
man and woman to get together in the face of obstacles, which must
be overcome one by one.  The story is suffused with eroticism.
The young protagonists' desire for one another are made manifest 
yet frustrated.

The *Acts* follows the pattern of the classical romance. A young
'virgin', Thecla, and a small, bow-legged and saintly-looking
Paul are cast in the role of lovers. Although the early Christian
author gives his (or her?) own spiritual spin on the love between 
Paul and Thecla, eroticism is abundantly present. Thecla, it is
made clear, is young and beautiful. The author emphasizes the effect 
of Thecla's looks on the other characters of the story. Thecla is 
repeatedly stripped naked for everyone to see (or imagine).

Thecla falls in love with Paul by hearing him preach. At this
point she hasn't met him. Yet she gazes longingly at him from a
distance. She searches for Paul like a lamb. She is dependent on
him.

The obstacles rising between Paul and Thecla are the making of
a patriarchal society whose primary goods are female virgins. Virgins
are to be married and made to multiply. Any teaching which -- 
like Paul's -- is turning women away from their traditional roles
of wives and children-factories are anathema to this society.
And indeed Thecla is several times put to death for having defied
and rejected here would-be suitors. The whole society turns against
the lovers. Even Thecla's mother demands her punishment with death.
Paul is locked up for corrupting the youth, in danger for his life.

Eventually Thecla meets Paul and announces that she has decided to
become a preacher of the gospel. The gospel she wants to preach is
the one of asceticism, and Paul gives his blessing. Interestingly,
once she starts her ministry, she takes on an androgynous or even
male look: she cuts off her hair and dresses like a man.

Every time Thecla is in deep trouble -- she faces being burnt at 
the stake, being eaten by beasts and being raped by hired thugs
-- she is saved by God, in anticipation (or support) of her coming
ministry.

What's more striking for us modern readers is the nature of Paul
and Thecla's love in the *Acts*. The classical romance eroticism 
and the bouts of sexual desire are wielded to convey a spiritual
love and a purely ascetic message. Little else comes into focus
in terms of Christian doctrine. True, this ascetic message is
overshadowed in Paul's epistles, but Paul's view of sexuality is
never so extreme. Yet it is this ascetic message that thrived for 
centuries within Christianity and seized the imagination of the 
clerical elites. (This is ironical especially because the *Acts* is
a non-canonical work, and the bible does not contain anything with so
drastic an ascetic message.)

Celibacy, chastity and asceticism have been seen for at least a
millennium and a half (up to the sixteenth century Reformation)
as superior to marriage and procreation. This superiority was
clearly endorsed by the Western (Christian) churches, where clerics 
had not been allowed to marry up to the Reformation. But asceticism 
was never repudiated by the Easter churches either, since there
bishops cannot marry and monasticism has been at its strongest.

Of course, this ascetic message couldn't have caught on with the
general population. Apart from catering to a common biological 
need for sexual relationships, the family, in some form, is the 
optimal unit within which to transmit moral and social goods to new 
generations, and a social arrangement that makes possible fulfilling 
relationships for both adults and children.

# Variety

Those who invoke traditional Christian values should be made
aware of the variety of early Christian views. We have had a
glimpse of how, from one generation to another and from one place 
to another, the proto-Christians views multiplied and took different 
shapes. The development of the Christian tradition, from its very
beginning, involved selective readings, interpretations and additions 
to the original ideas. These transformations had been in turn driven 
by the different theological views and the different social and
political needs of the early Christians.
