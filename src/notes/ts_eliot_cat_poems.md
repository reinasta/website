T.S. Eliot asked for no biography when he sensed his end was coming
closer. His need for privacy was extreme. The title (Old Possum ...)
begins with an allusion to the folklore about possums, namely that they
play dead when in trouble. Ezra Pound nicknamed Eliot as Possum because
of the latter\'s reluctance to talk about himself, in life or in poetry.

Himself a cat owner and lover -- cats whose names are as peculiar as
those in the cat poems -- he was fascinated by the independence,
superiority, and aloofness of his feline companions. As the critic John
Sutherland notes, \"no sensible religion has ever elevated the dog to
divine status\", but some did so elevate the cat, notoriously the Ancient
Egyptians.

(In a letter to a friend he even offers a tentative taxonomy for
different feline personalities, and some of this is present in the cats
poems.)

The cats are \'practical\' because they always do something; they seldom
purr, ask to be stroked or simply adorn the household -- the rather more
realistic representation of the domestic cat. Jennyanydots (The Old
Gumby Cat) is a domestic workaholic, Growltiger is a thug. The Rum Tum
Tagger is curious and fickle. The Jellicles are merry, almost mystical,
dancers. Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer are spoiled, music-hall
performers. Mr Mistoffelees is a trickster.

The cat poems were written starting in the mid 1930\'s and published in
book form in 1939. They were presents to children of friends and
Eliot\'s godchildren. Eliot enjoyed reading them out loud and there even
survives a recording of him reciting cat poems. (He was also very fond
of children, although he did not have any of his own. As Peter Ackroyd
remarks: he loved small animals, whether of the four- or two-legged
variety)

He draws on nursery rhymes and the nonsense poetry of Lewis Caroll and
Edward Lear.

> There was an Old Man in a tree, 
> Who was horribly bored by a Bee; 
> When they said, \"Does it buzz?\"
> He replied, \"Yes, it does!
> \"It\'s a regular brute of a Bee!\" 
> -- *Edward Lear (1812-1888), Book of Nonsense 10*

He also drew on passions such as Sherlock Holmes: Macavity, the Napoleon
of Crime, is a direct reference to Prof Moriarty.
