Bakunin, the anarchist thinker, told his sister "politics is religion and religion
is politics". If there is truth in his saying, it is one that's easy to miss.
Nowhere is this truth easier to miss that in discussions concerning the complicated
relation between Christians and Marxist-Leninists (or Communists).

Religious conservative and Marxist-Leninist thinkers alike bank on Communism's 
disavowal of religion.
For this attitude to religion allows conservatives to forge a connection between
atheism and the murderous nature of Communist regimes.
Marxists, on the other hand, see the same disavowal of religion as a way of uncovering
the social conditions that, in their view, draw people to a religious life.
So the two opposed world views feed off the antithesis between Communism and religion.
Yet this antithesis is false.
After all, as many historians have remarked, Communism *was* a political religion. 

Indeed there was an essential religious dimension to Communists' psychology and
social organization.
Socially, Communism was organized as a church, with its catechisms, sacred texts,
saints, and relics. 
Most non-ruling Communist parties were small and closed circles, not dissimilar to
the early Christian church and other religious sects.
Psychologically, the doctrine of inevitability of an ideal, classless society played
the main motivational part, especially for the Communists that did not come into
power.

But all these traits of religion are meant to support a more fundamental feature
of religion.
For religious life is possible even without revering relics and envisioning 
utopian futures.
Religion is a complex attitude to moral and aesthetic values. 
Religion is the entertaining, cherishing and aspiration to these values -- for
instance, compassion and beauty -- and involves an irreducible emotional commitment
to them.
(Keeping these values in the face of adversity is an important desideratum of
of religious life, although it can easily open up the road to dogmatism.)
This view, constructed around an individual's attitude towards value may seem
too individualistic. 
But religion, as even the original the origin of the word suggest, is a social
phenomenon. 
To incorporate this idea, we must say that is not only the attitudes to values 
that matter. What broadens religion is also the idea that those attitudes are 
shared or at least shareable with a community.
The significance of scared texts and relics is that they keep the focus of a
community on their values.


Now, political practice *can* be a quest for values one is emotionally attached to.
Setting up the institutions to promote moral and aesthetic values, when the act is
driven by an emotional commitment to these values, is just a manifestation of a
religious worldview, even when that worldview does not involve gods.
On this understanding of religion, many political systems appear as religious,
irrespective of theism or atheism, including fascists and Communists, but also
-- on the positive side -- Gandhi's and Martin Luther King's different political
and spiritual quests for improving their societies.
(The term religion, as I use it, is neither positive nor negative, but neutral.
The differences between the positive and the negative aspects of religions are,
of course, to do with the values cherished as well as with how the professed values
shape action.)

One can easily spot important differences between revolutionary political movements
and religious ones, but, I would argue, such differences do not preclude a shared 
religious core.

A difference is that religions, especially Christianity, found its place
in a society along with other ruling institutions. The Christian church stopped being
the key political player (if it ever was) and has mostly applied itself to the moral life 
of its people. 
Not so with Communists, who got a good grip of society in all its aspects, from
its traditional religious aspects (the discrimination against Orthodoxism in Russia)
to political organization (centered around the exclusive party leadership).
However, though of key political importance, the scope of a movement's might has
no bearing on its religious character, which depends, from my perspective, on certain
psychological attitudes and the social practices that support them.

There is an even more salient difference between traditional religions and communist
political religions. 
Most believers take their god(s) to be the other-worldly keepers of values.
Political revolutionaries, and in particular Communists, think that
values belong to this world or, at the very least, are to be realized within it.
But the differing placement of values, though metaphysically important,
is not constitutive of the religious phenomenon, which, as suggested, has much more 
important social and psychological traits: prophets, sacred texts, a purpose that 
gives meaning to individual action etc.
What's essential to all these is not that they draw their importance by reference
to god(s), but that they express values for humans to cherish and work on.
(I thus agree with Dworkin, who argued that religiousness should be distinguished
from belief in God, since the latter is just one of the manifestation of the former.)

Naturally, there are reasons that religiousness usually takes the form of a
belief in god(s). That's because god(s) are idealized models of human beings
and that their actions, associations and histories lend themselves to stories
and other narrative forms.
Stories about God and its followers are how values are, in fact,
expressed in the mainstream religious communities. If the stories promise an
other-worldly life in continuation to the present grievous ones, then they are
all the more compelling.

Simply talking about aspiration toward values and what those values amount to
does not have the narrative (and its specific emotional) power to capture people's
imagination. 
That's part of the reason why science and philosophy -- in their scholastic and
matter-of-fact rather than lively and practical forms -- are not cultural phenomena
as gripping and so not as wide spread as mainstream religions. 
That's not because they lack in religious character but because their religious
character, when it's manifest, is hidden in a bundle of complicated detail, which is,
currently, as a matter of fact, inaccessible to most of the people.



> Because of this scientific basis, however, Marxism is more than a mere science. It is a new way of looking at the past and the future, at the meaning of life, of the world, of thought; it is a spiritual revolution, it is a new world-view, a new life-system. As a system of life Marxism is real and living only through the class that adheres to it. (ch1)

> The struggle of a new class for power in State and society is at the same time always a spiritual struggle for a new world view. (ch2)
