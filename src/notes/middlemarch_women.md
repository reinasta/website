Before setting off on the long journey of reading
George Eliot's *Middlemarch*, I hadn't expected
this work to lend itself so readily to a feminist
reading. While subtle feminist readings can be given
to many works whose authors are not particularly 
concerned with the condition of women, Eliot approaches
the topic head on, from a host of angles, leaving no
doubt that it is among her keen interests. What's even more
surprising is how relevant the pleas of women -- or, to
be more precise, middle-class women, primarily but perhaps
not exclusively[^caveat] -- have remained to this day, as
we celebrate Eliot's birth two centuries ago.

[^caveat]: When I'll be speaking about women, I'll be referring 
to Eliot's women. But fictional characters are open-ended 
enough to illuminate human life beyond their specific fictional
context. So the women of the middle- and upper-classes
described by Eliot are bound to resemble many women 
of the same classes nowadays and perhaps their mental 
lives go beyond class and national boundaries, although
I will not make a case for the latter possibility here.

As a female writer with a deep sympathy for her characters,
Eliot was acutely aware of the limitations faced by the women 
of the middle-classes. The inner lives of her characters
reflect the norms governing men and women in Victorian society 
and the repercussions of not complying with these norms.

Eliot sets her novel in the provincial town of Middlemarch, 
housing the several upper-middle class industrialists 
and bankers, and its immediate surroundings, especially the 
estates of the landed gentry.

Dorothea, an energetic and idealistic young woman, is one
of the inhabitants of the estates, living with her sister
Celia under the custody of their uncle, Mr. Brooke. We get to
know her at the point she decides to marry a man -- Casaubon -- 
a couple of decades her senior. The marriage looks doomed
from the very beginning. Dorothea's energy looks wasted on his 
lethargy. And her enthusiastic plans are slowly subdued by his
stiff and polite reluctance.

Casaubon is an intellectual curate, writing -- as Dorothea will 
come to find out -- a hopelessly misguided book, the *Key to All 
Mythologies*, itself a scholarly unworkable mythology. He's 
distant, comically pompous but nevertheless attracted to the lively
Dorothea. Very quickly we find out that he can't enjoy his hopeful 
marriage, sinking as he will in a selfish realm of fear for the 
failure of his life project. (His magnum opus remains unwritten, 
Dorothea coming to inherit a jumble of notes.)

There is also an idealistic male counterpart to Dorothea.
Lydgate is an unconventional doctor. Unlike most Victorian
doctors, he pursues his medical studies not in Britain but in Paris. He 
begins his medical career in Middlemarch, since he thinks a provincial 
town is the best laboratory for the medical reforms he wishes to spread 
throughout Britain. He is young, smart, well-spoken and arrogant. 
Soon Lydgate meets Rosamond Vincy, and he conquers her without 
much effort, not least because he seems to embody Rosamnond's
ideals. Rosamond, the daughter of an industrialist, is frustrated
by the lack of glamour in provincial life and is taken with Lydgate 
for his family relations and social status. She is vain and stubborn. She 
lacks humour, but is clever, beautiful, with the manners, preoccupations 
and education of a woman meant to impress men in upper-class saloons. 

Rosamond's brother, Fred Vincy, is a good-natured but feckless young
man. Sent by his father to study to become a priest, he drops out, 
returns to Middlemarch and hangs there leisurely. He is in love with 
his childhood sweetheart, Mary Garth. The Garths are an industrious bunch.
Mr Garth is an estate manager and his wife is a former teacher. Far from
being well off, they shun Vincys' vain middle-class affectations.
In fact, the Garths are unassuming in all but their work-ethic and moral 
standards, and it's obvious that Eliot is partial to them. Mary is their 
eldest child. Smart, with dark humour, self-educated, Mary meets Fred's 
plans to marry her with mischievous sarcasm, not because she does not 
return his sentiments but because she wants to steer him away from his 
indolent course.


One common theme of Middlemarch is women's role in society. In this role, 
women should listen to their male counterpart's opinions and be modest,
docile, carrying and appreciative. Thus women's subordination to men is 
cast as proper behaviour.

Characters as different as Casaubon and Lydgate share one thought
in common: that the married life should bestow on men the comforts they 
need in order to advance their careers. "I feel sure" says Lydgate "that 
marriage must be the best thing for a man who wants to work steadily".
Mr. Trumbull, the real estate agent, advises that "a man whose life is 
of any value should think of his wife as a nurse". (If his claim does 
not sound farcical enough, Mr. Trumbull rounds out his case by adding
"I believe I have lived single long enough not to make a mistake in that 
line".) And indeed a caregiver is what Dorothea becomes to Casaubon: 
"She nursed him, she read to him, she anticipated his wants, and was 
solicitous about his feelings". For all her effort, Dorothea satisfied 
Casaubon only partially because of "his suspicions that he was not any 
longer adored without criticism".

Women's intelligence is often insulted.

Mr Brooke, Dorothea's uncle, is a well-meaning and benignly
prejudiced man. "Young ladies don't understand political economy"
we hear him say in answer to one of Dorothea's house management
pursuits. Mr Brooke is a mine of amusing non-sequiturs directed at
women. As for the women on the receiving end of male condescension, 
Mary Garth banters with Fred Vincy: "I do like to be spoken to as 
if I had common-sense. I really often feel as if I could understand 
a little more than I ever hear even from young gentlemen who have 
been to college."

Young ladies live their teenage years with the prospect of 
marriage looming before them, and once they get married they
surrender their self-asserting desires to their husbands. They 
are doomed either to the never ending domestic work, or to an
unproductive life of boredom. (Even an exception to this rule 
like Mary's mother, Mrs Garth, is herself under a misapprehension 
about the subordinated role of women, which she believes to be
their natural role.)

"A woman dictates before marriage in order that she may have 
an appetite for submission afterwards" comments Eliot's narrator.
And among the upper-class women, the new bride is to be "keeping 
up the sense of busy ineffectiveness, as of a dream which the 
dreamer begins to suspect". Since they are soon soaked into "the 
stifling oppression of that gentlewoman's world, where everything 
was done for her and none asked for her aid".

Those who don't abide by the gendered norms fall prey to gossip 
and moral isolation. Will Ladislaw, for instance, is a young man 
with artistic leanings and without any proper male occupation. 
He's more of a nomad. He takes up a job as an editor to a reforming 
newspaper, and neglects his financial interests. As a consequence 
he makes few friends in Middlemarch.

Will himself is the one who gives us a subtle glimpse of what
happens to women transgressing the social expectation that they 
should be attentive and deferring to men. When Dorothea launches 
on a passionate and eloquent speech, Will himself -- perhaps the
most open minded of the characters -- perceives her as cold. For 
the same reason, other people see Dorothea as lacking femininity.

One of the less subtle reactions to Dorothea's intellectual 
curiosity and aplomb is Lydgate's. "She did not look at things from 
the proper feminine angle", Lydgate thought. "The society of such 
women was about as relaxing as going from your work to teach the 
second form, instead of reclining in a paradise with sweet 
laughs for bird-notes, and blue eyes for a heaven." Lydgate is 
not at ease before women of an inquisitive and thoughtful 
bent of mind, to the point of finding them unfeminine. 
(The 'sweet laughs' and 'blue eyes' alluded to in these passages 
are Rosamond's, whom Lydgate innocently starts to court -- he later 
comes to doubt his choice.)

The philosopher Kate Manne classifies as misogynist all the adverse 
reactions to women overstepping the boundaries of gendered proprieties.
Misogyny, in her view, is not the elusive hatred of women, but rather 
a way of acting so as to enforce sexist norms, those norms that 
underpin the social expectations that women should subordinate themselves
in taking a specific caring role -- doing physical, emotional and 
mental work for men and keeping clear from masculine-coded activities 
and aspirations. Misogyny then inflicts penalties on those men 
and women who stray from these norms. Manne focuses her analysis of 
misogynistic acts on luminaries such as Donald Trump and Rush 
Limbaugh, who wouldn't dream of figuring in a George Eliot 
novel. In Middlemarch, the misogyny is much subtler, expressed 
through  the nervous twitches and the gossipy conversations of various
Victorian gentlemen. 

Just because women suffer for the limitations Victorian society
imposes on them, Eliot does not think of them as mere victims. 
Yes, women inhabit a limited social space and see
their life choices curtailed. But they can exercise power
within that confined space. One obvious exercise of power is a 
rather negative one. Rosamond proves not to be Lydgate's ideal
compliant partner but a single-minded woman who invariably has
her own way. In pursuing her rigid aims, she thwarts Lydgate's 
plans time and time again. Lydgate, in turn, is well-intentioned,
but -- as we've seen -- deeply prejudiced against women and too 
proud to explain himself to Rosamond in time to avoid financial 
troubles. In the end, they all but wreck their marriage.

Lydgate believes women are shallow creatures, whose interest can't
penetrate below the surfaces of their surrounding world. Without 
realizing, so is he in all things but his medical profession and 
his high-minded reform plans. In Eliot's words, "Lydgate's spots 
of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices, which, in 
spite of noble intention and sympathy, were half of them such as 
are found in ordinary men of the world".

Lydgate's fate is to end up as no more than a façade himself, 
subject to his partner's precious tastes. For if women (or men,
for that matter) are raised to be frivolous, this will bear on 
their choice of partners. Indeed, Rosamond marries him for his 
noble relations and imagines she could thus leap into high society.
Everything else is secondary to this aim. In particular, she lets
him know that she despises his most dear medical preoccupations.
As Lydgate chides her: "to say that you love me without loving the 
medical man in me, is the same sort of thing as to say that you like 
eating a peach but don't like its flavor".

The writer Rebecca Mead points out in her excellent *My Life
In Middlemarch* that Rosamond is the kind of woman who would envisage
her life through the lenses of soap-opera romances. Eliot had a 
particular disdain for such novels. One of her essays *Silly Novels 
by Lady Novelists* lambastes the shallow recipes and 
the insipid characters of popular Victorian romance. Rosamond's
character is a sublimated form of the same critique.

Eliot shows human beings in their full complexity, with a rich 
emotional register pointing them in all moral (or less than moral) 
directions. Even the more negative characters are shown in a better 
light, at least from their own perspectives. Eliot believes that 
rational inquiry has to draw on lived experience and feeling. 
Eliot's characters receive a sympathetic ear, as well as 
a good dose of subtle irony and witty criticism. This also shapes 
Eliot's critique of gender norms. Her view of gender roles is far from 
schematic. She does not divide people in oppressors and oppressed.
Her realism is middle class: interested in describing the social life 
in the novelist's experience and purview. She is honest about that. 
She's clear that in bringing her characters before us, she is doing 
it from a necessarily limited perspective. "Our impartiality is kept 
for abstract merit and demerit, which none of us ever saw", she has 
the narrator say at one point. It is also clear that her world is
that of the relatively privileged, but it is what she knew. 

For all her subtlety in portraying women, Eliot can hardly be described 
as a feminist. In fact, the literary critic Tim Dolin went further to 
argue (convincingly) that "Eliot’s richest insights come out of political 
and social convictions that are deeply conservative, anti-democratic, and 
avowedly anti-feminist".

As a realist novelist stressing the role of experience, Eliot couldn't 
miss the prejudices and injustices surrounding her. But once she registered 
these difficulties, she had a particularly conservative way of responding 
to them. Eliot did not believe in protest and legislative improvement in 
pursuit of justice. Her view was that through education women will become 
aware of prejudice but also of the ineffectiveness of rushing change via
political movements. She would rather urge women to improve society
through their own moral example within the spaces to which they were
confined and wait for this moral influence to slowly spread with the coming
generations. Unlike Eliot herself, her female characters end up renouncing 
their aspirations to act on the larger world. Their passions fade away. And 
they come to see virtue in this renunciation, a duty of care for the sake of 
the loved ones. Far from portraying this as a demise, Eliot's suggests that 
this the slow march towards progress. And she sees art itself as a way of 
coming to terms with one's social limitations and as a way to find one's 
moral bearings.

Whatever one thinks of Eliot's view of moral progress, her perceptive prose 
keeps speaking eloquently to the need for progress on the condition of 
women.
