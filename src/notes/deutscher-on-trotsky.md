### Bolsheviks come into power

Throughout most of 1917 Russia had been led by the provisional government,
after February, when the latter had replaced the old Tsarist regime.
The provisional government held the central authority, but at a local level 
a nascent institution called *the soviet* was taking hold, especially in the cities.
The soviets were political organizations controlled by the working people --
workers and peasants -- through their representatives
who could be affiliated with one of the many Russian 
parties (initially even with the bourgeoisie) and form a Soviet of Workers 
organized by a congress with legislative power. 
Bolsheviks started their attack on the provisional government with the 
popular slogan 'all power to the soviets'.
These local self-governed organizations, the Bolshevik thought, should replace 
the provisional government. 
If the Bolshevik representatives in the soviets were still dominated 
by SRs and Mensheviks following the first congress (in June 1917), the
Bolshevik hoped to gain a majority once they had made their popular 
policies known to the public.
Very soon the Bolsheviks did surpass both parties at the second congress
held in October 1917.


At the end of October and throughout November 1917, the Bolsheviks took
the first steps towards seizing
[complete](http://www.orlandofiges.info/section6_TheOctoberRevolution1917/EstablishingtheBolshevikDictatorship.php) power. 
To Bolsheviks, holding the power and, through it, enforcing a strong and disciplined 
organization, were means to their primary goal of securing the revolution, the reversal 
of the social and political establishment in favor of the working people.
Animated by their goal, the Bolsheviks moved decisively.
They banned the opposition press and arrested its leaders.
They decided that Sovnarkom, the soviet government's[^sovgov] legislative body, 
can pass legislation without approval from the soviets, in breach of the 
principle that power belongs to the soviets (cf A 33). 
The Bolsheviks followed up, in 1921, with a total ban on the opposition parties.
The ban was meant to protect their New Economic Policy, and was to be lifted once the 
country would become more stable (see e.g. Deutscher, chpt 14).
As this never happened, we had right there the beginning of the unique party
system, a key feature of all Communist regimes. (see Archie Brown)


[^sovgov]: The [Soviet Government](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/s/o.htm#soviet-government) 
was an organization consisting of a legislative body called 
the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom), and an executive body called the 
Central Executive Committee. While initially the Soviets controlled the
government (which amounted to a dictatorship of the proletariat), the Soviets
lost control of the government during the civil war and the Central Committee
of the Communist Party (and its executive core, the 
[Politbureau](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/p/o.htm#politburo)) 
controlled the government in order to ensure a better management of the conflict. 
The government's management never again got back to the Soviets after the civil war.


Leon Trotsky, one of the main Bolshevik actors in these events, later remarked:

> The prohibition of oppositional parties brought after it the prohibition 
> of factions. The prohibition of factions ended in a prohibition to think 
> otherwise than the infallible leaders. The police-manufactured monolithism 
> of the party resulted in a bureaucratic impunity which has become the 
> sources of all kinds of wantonness and corruption. (L. Trotsky, 
> [The Revolution Betrayed](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/))

Trotsky has identified the issue, and yet, he regarded it as a tragedy rather
than a mistake, since he also believed that the prohibition of parties was justified 
in the circumstances of 1921.

The Bosheviks had the support of the army -- including the enthusiastic support of 
the Kronstadt garrison -- but in October 1917 they also set up their own security organization,
the [secret police](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/orgs/s/o.htm#soviet-secret-police).
Initially called Checka, the secret police was meant to defend the revolution. 
It would soon become one of the main tools of control used by the soviet government, 
doing such jobs as the requisitioning of food, the secret arrest of the opposition 
leaders, torture and summary execution. 
(In later incarnation the secret police split in different agencies called, since 1922 
NKVD and GPU, and, after 1954, KGB.) 

The Bolsheviks' tactical shift comes to light if we consider the fate of 
another Russian institution of the revolutionary period:
the [Constituent Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Constituent_Assembly).
The Assembly was an elected legislature that catered for the rights and interests of 
the Russian citizens. 
At the beginning, this institution had a wide support among the Russian parties. 
Not only the Bolsheviks but also the Octobrists, the Kadets, 
the Social Revolutionaries (SRs) and the Mensheviks called for the Assembly.
Lenin endorsed it on behalf of the Bolsheviks in his guidelines for their 
revolutionary activities, known as the April Theses.
While still on his way toward Russia Lenin expressly denied in his Theses that
he was hostile to the Assembly and reaffirmed the need to set it up.

> I attacked the Provisional Government for not having appointed an early date or 
> any date at all, for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, and for confining 
> itself to promises. I argued that without the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ 
> Deputies the convocation of the Constituent Assembly is not guaranteed and its 
> success is impossible.

> And the view is attributed to me that I am opposed to the speedy convocation of 
> the Constituent Assembly! (Lenin, [April Theses](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/apr/04.htm)**

*Qui s'excuse s'accuse!* we might say in the light of the coming events, but
it is true that in the confusion and turmoil of 1917, Lenin, strong-willed and
disciplined as he was, could not be completely clear-headed.

Lenin's initial plan was to establish a multi-party Constituent Assembly as a 
legislative addition to the local governments (the soviets). 
Soon the Bolsheviks realized this did not tally with their slogan that all the 
power should go to the soviets.
Lenin envisaged a change of plans. 
The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly was a move that would not only dispel 
the tension between the soviets and the Assembly, but would also benefit Lenin's own
party. 
For the Bolsheviks failed to secure the majority in the elections of delegates
to the Constituent Assembly and had to submit to the Social Revolutionaries. 
The right wing of the SRs -- which had just split from its left wing but still
held the majority -- opposed the soviets in favour of keeping the provisional 
government in power. 
Both the Soviet leadership and the Constituent Assembly were democratically
elected, but, the Bolshevik argued, Soviets are more democratic since the
delegates can be instantly changed by their electoral bases while a change
in the Constituent Assembly can take several years.
So the choice they faced was between the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'
emanating from the soviets and the parliamentarianism represented by the Assembly.

That was not a difficult choice to make.
In January 1918, the Red Guards, acting on behalf of the Bolsheviks, simply 
locked out the delegates of the Assembly.
No significant public outcry followed, as the Assembly was hardly 
a popular institution.
Workers preferred the soviets. 
Peasants, on their part, remained unconcerned as they 
associated the Constituent Assembly with the provisional government.
Following its poor performance and the hardships of WWI, the provisional 
government had lost credibility.
Even more important to the peasantry was that the provisional government
and the Assembly offered no guarantee that the gentry's land that had just 
been given to the peasants would not be taken back.
In contrast, the Bolsheviks -- borrowing the policy from the Left
Social Revolutionaries -- supported the distribution of land from the
very beginning of the revolution. (A 10-11)

The harsh war conditions allowed Bolsheviks to get the better of
the dominant parties within the soviets.
Thus, the third congress -- taking place on the day following the Assembly's
dispersal -- changed the balance of power within the soviets in favour of
the Bolsheviks.

In the aftermath of the Assembly's dispersal, the Social Revolutionaries 
decided to take no action against Bolsheviks and, instead, to return to 
the soviets (after having left them in October 1917), hoping to re-gain power 
once the Bolsheviks' revolutionary aura faded out.
Their plan was to be only partially vindicated.
The elections in the spring of 1918 did give the SRs majorities within the
soviets. 
And yet the Bolsheviks controlled the Soviet government and could 
outmanoeuvre their rivals. 
Promptly, they refused to recognize many of the SRs' election successes 
and dissolved the soviets where the Bolsheviks did not secure majorities.
Later the Social Revolutionaries would change tack and plan to overthrow
the Bolsheviks and bring back the Assembly but it was too late (A 44-5).

As the Bolsheviks saw the situation, they had no other responsible choice 
than to take the power. 
While staying in power meant saving the revolution,
any compromise towards other parties would have meant endangering the 
unique opportunity of changing the truly oppressive social and political 
landscape of Russia and -- as they thought -- of Europe as a whole.


### War communism

Given that the Bolsheviks supported a number of popular policies (most importantly,
the allocation of land to the working peasants), it is likely that the Russian 
population would not have called into question the Bolshevik leadership, were it not 
for the tormenting living conditions and the oppressive power of the new bureaucracy.

The form of revolutionary organization that best epitomized the pitiable 
position of Russians of the 1917-1921 period was war communism.
During this period the Bolsheviks tried to set up a number of 
bold communist policies that centralized the control of the economy and put
and end to the markets.
The Bolsheviks abolished private property, nationalized the industry 
and practically -- due to the surging inflation -- replaced money with rations 
and direct exchanges of goods. 
The rationing of food was accompanied by the confiscation of the surpluses from 
agriculture -- a much hated intervention among the peasants. 
What made the Bolshevik rule more difficult was that the surpluses were vanishing: 
the peasants produced strictly what they consumed and, therefore, the workers in 
the cities saw their food rations diminishing. 
The difficulties were compounded by the scarcity and political instability 
brought about by the civil war.

Meanwhile Trotsky, encouraged by his military success in organizing the Red Army
during the civil war, 
thought of solving the crisis by approaching labour in a military style. He tried
to impose military discipline in the factories, obligating, for instance, all
able-bodied adults to take up work, using army units to supervise them, and 
attempting to enlist the unions as the state's organs of labour control.
Using the soldiers who had just fought the civil war and were eager to be released, 
he formed 'labour armies' to be deployed for civic duties. This was Trotsky's 
militarization of labour, a policy of forced labour which the Mensheviks
did not fail to compare to slavery. The militarization of labour provoked
fierce debates within the Communist party and brought a new wave of resent upon the 
Bolsheviks all the while doing nothing to improve productivity (A 26ff).
(It did Trotsky no good either, as it weakened his position in the party struggles.)

During war communism one third of the urban workers moved to the countryside 
to be closer to the sources of food. Those workers that stayed put were starving
and stole what they produced to barter it for food and thus supplement their 
meagre daily rations.
The industrial output in 1920 was the third of what it used to be in 1913.
The vast natural resources of Russia couldn't be exploited because the newly
recaptured oil fields and coal basins were in disarray.
The industry was receiving hard blows. (A 21ff)

In response, requisition squads resorted to violence, assuming kulaks -- which
meant rich peasants but the term came to be applied to any peasant that seemed 
to oppose requisition plans -- were hiding food in order to use it for 'speculation'.
(cf. A 26)
All too often the squads beat and tortured peasants until the required amount of food 
was produced.
But terror was failing to keep the newly instated Communist society alive.
Such was the desperation of Russian countryside that tens of thousands of peasants 
and newly returned soldiers took to arms.
They formed guerrillas to loot food and fight the requisition detachments. 
The urban workers fared no better and soon the army and navy will be pooled
into the maelstrom.


### Kronstadt

In the especially cold winter of 1920-21, sixty of the large factories 
of Petrograd had to be closed due to lack of fuel. 
At the end of February when spontaneous strikes broke out in the 
factories that remained open, Zinoviev sent troops to stifle the 
unrest and closed some of the factories. 
Closing these factories was a form of punishment as the workers were 
no longer entitled to food rations and a warning for other workers 
who thought of striking (A 41).
Zinoviev ordered the arrest of Mensheviks who were among the chief 
agitators although, unlike the Social Revolutionaries, they had no 
intention to overthrow the Bolsheviks (A 44).
In Petrograd, at the beginning of 1921, the Checka arrested five 
thousand Mensheviks and many of the anarchists' and SRs' leaders 
that were still at large (A 47).

Following this show of force, Zinoviev did take more popular decisions.
He distributed emergency food rations, put an end to the ban on trade
and announced plans of abandoning the seizure of grain. (S 202, A 49)

Just as the protests were beginning to calm down in Petrograd -- at the price 
of turning the city into an armed camp, as Avrich (46) put it -- the unrest 
was spreading to a little island in the vicinity. The Kotlin island, as it was
called, was harbouring the Kronstadt garrison (part of the Baltic Fleet), 
a fortress and their battleships. 
The sailors of Kronstadt had been active participants in the revolution, 
which prompted Trotsky to call them 'the pride and glory of the revolution'. 
But this time Kronstadt was to join those discontent with Bolshevik rule.
On February 26 the sailors of Kronstadt had already sent their 
representatives to investigate the grievances of workers in Petrograd, 
and when the representatives came back with a report, the sailors decided 
to strengthen the fading protests of Petrograd, setting forth a list of 
explicit demands. (S 202)

#### First attack

The sailors of Kronstadt formulated their demands in the Petropavlovsk 
Resolution, named after the ship on which the meeting took place at the
end of February. 
Several days later, on March 1, the resolution was almost unanimously 
adopted at a mass meeting in Kronstadt's Anchor Square.
The demands put forward were, among other things, for free speech, free 
unions and free soviets. 
The resolution was a sign of the growing discontent with the Bolshevik
leadership. 
The Kronstadt sailors thought of themselves as giving voice to workers' 
and peasants' grievances. They were a free and untamed bunch, in more
confident position to step up the protests than the rest of the Petrograd 
society.

One of the leaders in Kronstadt, Stepan Petrichenko was cited by New York 
Times saying that the sailors felt duped by the Bolsheviks: as they were out 
on the front fighting the civil war on Bolsheviks' side, the latter were busy 
repressing the troops' peasant families back home (S 205). 
The view attributed to Petrichenko -- despite being aired in a 'bourgeois'
paper -- was accurately expressing the peasantry's discontent with the soviet
government and Lenin was fully aware of this (A 13, 25).

The publication of the Petropavlovsk Resolution in Kronstadt's local paper
provoked a cascade of soviet reactions.

On February 28, Zinoviev sparked off the soviet diatribes by calling 
the sailors 'SR-Black Hundreds', that is,
right-wing vigilantes that had previously assisted the monarchy in 
repressing the workers.
This characterization couldn't have but enraged a revolutionary.

Trotsky, as the Commissar of War, was directly involved in framing
the nature of the protests in Kronstadt.
He voiced his concerns for the first time on February 29.
He worried that there had been an anti-revolutionary conspiracy behind
the Kronstadt events. 
In a 'top secret' message to the head of E.I Batis, the Baltic Fleet, 
Trotsky wrote: (G 29-30)

> There are repeated reports in the foreign press on
> conspiracies and uprisings in Kronstadt and in the
> Balt[ic] Fleet. Our entire past experience tells us
> that such rumours precede real events since the centres
> of conspiracies are situated abroad and in the foreign
> press such information about conspiracies that are being
> prepared emanates from White Guardist émigré circles.
> Thus [it happened] for example, in Nizhnii Novgorod and
> many times before. It is essential to discuss this problem
> with all competent bodies and to take all necessary
> preventive measures.


From March 2 on, Zinoviev alongside Kalinin and Lashevich, 
started to think about forcibly containing Kronstadt 
and asked Trotsky for military assistance. (G 30)

On the same day, Lenin and Trotsky signed an official government 
announcement. In it, they were charging Kronstadt of anti-revolutionary 
activities instigated by French intelligence agents, condemned
once more "the adoption of a Black-Hundred-SR resolution", and,
for a novelty, accused Kronstadt of receiving backing from 
Tsarists General Kozlovskii and three of his officers.
(Kozlovskii was indeed on the island, having been placed there 
by Trotsky himself.)
Then, on March 3, the Petrograd Soviet issued a public 
denunciation to the same effect: there was a 'White Guardist 
conspiracy' in Kronstadt; the *entente* was behind it or at least 
was taking advantage of it; and Mensheviks and SRs were among the 
chief instigators. (G 30)

Whether Lenin, who put his signature on the public announcement,
really believed in a White Guardist conspiracy is not clear.
For about two weeks later, Lenin admited that Kronstad was no 
Tsarist stronghold:

> There [in Kronstadt] they do not want either the whiteguards or 
> our government—and there is no other—and as a result they find 
> themselves in a situation which speaks best of all in our favour 
> and against any new government. (Lenin's Collected Works, vol 32)

This, of course, was no defense of Kronstadt, since as Lenin made
clear in his speech he also thought of the conflict as bound to 
benefit the Whites, unless the Bolsheviks intervened decisively. 
Lenin, and virtually all his colleagues, saw Kronstadt as 
a negligible force squeezed between the Whites and the Bolsheviks 
-- an unenviable position that was to make Kronstadt the object of 
violent suppression.

Indeed it didn't take long for Bolsheviks to decide that crushing
the Kronstadt uprising was the only solution to the conflict. On
March 5, Trotsky summoned from the Western Front one of his most 
experienced generals, M.N. Tukhachevsky. (C)

Tukhachevsky's authority over the military was needed to crush 
Kronstadt, since Bolsheviks feared, not without justification, 
that the troops would be unwilling to fight against Kronstadt (C).
Motivating reluctant troops and preventing their defection were 
problems that had been haunting the soviet government since the
beginning of the civil war.

Tukhachevsky arrived in Petrograd on March 6.
Together, Tukhachevsky and Trotsky appealed 'all those who have
taken up arms against the Socialist Fatherland to lay
down their arms. Those who resist will be disarmed and
handed over to the Soviet authorities. Only those who
surrender unconditionally may count on the mercy of the
Soviet republic' (G 32). Trotsky and Tukhachevsy's appeal
comes across as moderate compared to the vengeful pleas 
emanating from Petrograd at the time. 
Two days earlier, for instance, Petrograd adopted an Appeal 
to the Workers, Sailors and Soldiers of Kronstadt, ordering 
them 'you must immediately arrest the ringleaders of the 
counter-revolutionary conspiracy! ... Decide immediately: 
you are either with us against the common enemy, or you will
perish shamefully and ignominiously together with the
counter-revolutionaries!'. (G 31) On the same day came 
an Appeal of the Petrograd Defence
Committee, addressed to the 'deceived Kronstadters'.
'If you should stubbornly persist' the appeal read
'you will be shot down like partridges ... Disarm and
arrest the criminal ring-leaders, in particular the
tsarist generals! He who surrenders immediately will
be pardoned!' (G 32)

These messages displayed the same manichaeistic reasoning 
that Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders espoused at the time.
As the Kronstadters would not relent, the Bosheviks saw no 
other way forward than to make good on their threats.
Thus, the 10,000 strong, 7th Red Army began the first 
attack on Kronstadt on March 7-8.

The assault was miscalculated.
Trotsky was all too eager to take Kronstadt, since,
as he wrote on March 5 to Skilanskii, "A more determined 
character would make a turn for the better in Petrograd, 
if not Kronstadt." "Only suppression of Kronstadt" Trotsky 
added "will end the political crisis in Petrograd". So he 
pressed Tukhachevsky to launch the offensive though the 
general had just arrived at the front line a day before 
and had little time for preparation. (C 21)

Tukhachevsky had trouble controlling his troops (S 205-6).
On the night of the attack, a battalion of the 561st 
Regiment defected to the Kronstaders leaving its 
companion battalion in the Southern group exposed. 
This caused great losses (C 24, 29).

Yet other troops refused to go on the ice for fear 
that it would crack under their feet (cf. S). 
What's more, the troops in the most forward position on 
the front feared that they would come under the fire of the 
less advanced fellow soldiers that were supposed to
offer support. 
As the attack was conducted during the night, such 
accidents were facilitated by the lack of visibility. (C 24)

Tukhachevsky later criticized the rush operation and 
complained that he had been misinformed by the Cheka 
on the sailors' capacity to fight back (C 24).


#### Bolshevik political plans

In spite of the disappointing start, soviet leaders
were thinking ahead and, on March 8, plans of repression 
were already in the works. Trotsky favoured a Troika 
'for the filtration of the mutineers and the investigation of
their connections'. The Troika was the project of Vasily
Sevei, Plenipotentiary of the Special Section of Cheka.
Sevei's report, which had been, in fact, prepared
a month before the revolt, showed only contempt for the
Kronstadters (G 32-3):

> in place of proletarian ideology they have substituted
> their unshakeable conviction that they are the pride, glory 
> and vanguard of the revolution ... These sailors were and 
> still are professional revolutionaries and could well form 
> the basis for a possible third revolution. The disease from 
> which they suffer has been too long neglected and must now 
> be cured by surgical methods; as there is no time left for
> organic remedies. The most effective method is the setting 
> up of a completely independent Extraordinary Troika which 
> would act on your [Trotsky's] directives and be directly
> responsible to the Special Section of the Cheka ... The 
> work of this Troika will be regarded as at an end only when 
> all undesirable elements have been completely filtered and 
> when the mutineers' ties with right-wing political parties 
> have been fully exposed and the involvement of Estonia and
> Finland has been fully established. The Troika must also 
> have the power to punish, including the imposition of the
> supreme penalty.

The Troika was thus a response to the sailors' non-proletarian
and anti-revolutionary attitudes identified by the main Bolshevik 
line. 
It aimed to first expose and then clean Kronstadt of 
the right-wing and foreign influences.
(Interestingly, there circulated an alternative plan involving
a 5-person body for the filtering of Kronstadt but its
members were less devout to the Bolshevik line, which in
the end counted against them. More on this later.) 

A similar initiative was put forth by Ivan Sladkov, 
a veteran Kronstadt Bolshevik.
Sladkov wrote in a 'Most Urgent, Top Secret' note to 
Skliansky that:

> In the Kronstadt garrison the power of the mutineers
> shows great initiative ... All exhortations and appeals
> have no effect, as the Left SRs have succeeded in
> deceiving the majority of the mass of soldiers, sailors
> and workers of Kronstadt and have entered into a close
> alliance with the White Guardist officers and handed
> power over to them ... They planted in the more fortified
> places of Kronstadt packs of Mensheviks, SRs and such-like
> scum ... As I see it, that den must be finished off ...
> Otherwise it may affect the external side of the republic.

Sladkov too thought that the opposition parties and the
Whites were manipulating the sailors to advance their own
political goals.
In the same note, he asked Skliansy to insist at the tenth 
congress on the need of purging the entire navy in order to 
avoid similar revolts and secure the republic. (G 34)

At the same time accusations of counter-revolution and
plans of repression were pouring from Bolshevik quarters, 
on March 8 Kronstadt released a statement complaining about 
the lack of freedom and the repression led by Cheka. This 
was titled 'What we are fighting for' (S 203-4):

> In carrying out the October Revolution, the working class was
> hoping to throw off the yoke of oppression. Yet that revolution
> resulted in an even greater enslavement of the human person.
 
> The power of the police–gendarme monarchism fell into the
> hands of the conquering Communists, who instead of freedom gave
> the working people the constant fear of ending up in a Cheka
> dungeon, the horrors of which have surpassed those of a tsarist
> gendarme prison by many degrees ...
 
> But what is more vile and criminal than all else is the moral
> servitude created by the Communists: they have violated even the
> interior life of the working people, forcing them to think only
> in the Communist way.
 
> They chained workers to their machines with the help of official
> trade unions, transforming their labor from a joy into a new slavery.
> The peasants, whose protests manifested themselves in spontaneous
> rebellions, and the workers, who were forced by the circumstances of

> of bloodthirstiness for which the tsar’s generals were famous ...
 
> [But] the long patience of the working people has reached its end.
> Here in Kronshtadt, the first stone of the third revolution has been

> party pressure, and to revamp the official trade unions into voluntary
> associations of workers, peasants and the laboring intelligentsia.
> At last, the police club of the Communist autocracy has been smashed.

This statement reads like an apt description of war communism seen
from the perspective of the working people. It mentions the repressive
measures of the secret police, the forced labour, and the bad living and
working conditions. But it also goes beyond these to what Kronstaders 
took to be the moral failing of the Bolshevik leadership.

Despite the previously cited Bolshevik statements, Kronstadters were 
less inspired 
by Mensheviks or SRs than by anarchism and libertarian-communism. 
However, this affinity was not exclusive, as most of their demands
-- like freedom of speech and of assembly, local soviet power --
were among the initial promises of the Bolsheviks.
As Isaac Deutscher, Trotsky's excellent biographer (and a sympathetic
one to boot), put it, "what the rebels of Kronstadt demanded was only 
what Trotsky had promised their elder brothers and what he and the 
party had been unable to give." (cf. S 204)

However, Bolsheviks didn't think so much of ideology at this point
as of the necessity to save the revolution at any price and this
entailed -- as intimated by Lenin's argumentation -- keeping the
Bolsheviks in power as the only true representatives of the working
people, even at the cost of suppressing part of the population.
Thus, on March 10, Trotsky put out another anxious warning about 
Kronstadt: "I fear that neither the Party nor the members of the
Central Committee fully realise the exceptional gravity of the 
Kronstadt problem". (G 35)


#### The second attack

Meanwhile, Tukhachevsky ordered on March 10 a systematic and continuous 
bombardment of Kronstadt. 
(The guns were too weak to reach the citadel, but the general was
happy with their psychological effect.)

The new plan of an immediate attack of Kronstadt had to be put off.
Tukhachevsky was expecting his most reliable troops, making up the Omsk 
division, to arrive from the Western front. 
As these troops were pulling in between March 11 and 13, Tukhachevsky 
learned, to his dismay, that they were unwilling to fight.
Other mutinies followed. 
Three regiments of the 27th Divisions arrived in Petrograd with their
minds made up -- thanks to SR and Menshevik agitation -- that they would 
not fight. 
Soldiers of the 235th Regiment, moreover, asked to contact Kronstadt 
before joining the fray, as they could not believe the sailors succumbed 
to White generals. 
These untrustworthy brigades were quickly isolated from the Red Army. (C 30-32)

At this point of maximal disarray among troops, the Bolsheviks resorted to
the well tested tactics of the civil war: revolutionary agitation and political
repression.
On March 13, the relatives of Kronstadt leaders and alleged leaders were arrested 
in Petrograd. (C)
Then Lenin took the initiative; in what was likely the most
significant tactic of these days, he urged a few hundred Communist 
luminaries to take to the front line and stir up the reluctant soldiers. 
On March 15, it was Tukhachevsky's turn to give the Omsk division a 
motivational speech. 
Invoking the heroic days of the civil war, he pleaded with them to act 
in like manner and 'storm the traitors of Kronstadt!'. 
A military tribunal was also pressed into service.
S.G. Pliutto, a leader of the Petrograd Military District, reported
on March 16 that 60 members of the 79th Brigade of the Omsk Division
had been shot to restore order (C 32).
Other repressive acts came from the extraordinary troika led by Aleksei
Nikolaev.
The troika arrested over a hundred soldiers deemed anti-Communists, 
and publicly shot 74 of them (S 205, G 35).

And then there were the so-called 'blocking detachments'.
These military groups had as their job to ensure that the offensive 
forces did not withdraw and to shoot anyone deemed a deserter.
Tukhachevsky had used blocking detachments throughout the civil war and
brought them with him to Kronstadt. (C 32-3)

Only with these measures in place was an attack on Kronstadt possible. 
On the night of March 17-8 some 25,000 Red Army
soldiers pushed through the knee-deep water which
covered the ice surrounding the Kotlin island. Backed 
by artillery on the northern and southern parts of the gulf of 
Finland, this massive assault finally pierced the sailors'
defences.
In the morning, Kronstadt was falling apart. 
Some 2,000 soldiers died on each side. 
Several thousand sailors escaped across the ice to
Finland; the unlucky among the fugitives drowned and were 
later to be washed out on the Finish shores. (S 206)

After taking Kronstad, Tukhachevsky left at once, without
setting foot on the island. 
The political suppression was left to the Checka and the
party organizations. (C 40)



### Soviet measures

The 'filtering' and 'purging' of Kronstadt begun even
before the fortress had been completely taken.
The Troika led by Nikolaev had to rely solely on the
information provided by the Cheka, since, as Nikolaev
complained, 'neither commissars nor local Communists 
provided any material'.
The immediate soviet reports registered 3000 sentences, 
40% to death and the rest to deportation. Later reports 
registered as many as 6000 sentences, although they
did not specify what these sentences amounted to.
(S 206, G 36)

The civilian population of Kronstadt was to receive a
softer blow. 
A secret report issued on April 21 laid out the plan
for the circa 9,000 people remaining in Kronstadt, the 
majority of whom were women and children (and largely 
the mutineers' families):

> such masses of useless and even harmful people, should,
> like so much ballast, be speedily removed from the
> fortress ... and for the following reasons: (a) these
> 9,000 people increase the number of eaters in the fortress
> by 16 per cent; (b) though they are not occupied in
> productive and useful work for the fortress, they occupy
> more than 3,000 rooms and complicate an already severe
> accommodation crisis; (c) this type of population ...
> has a high rate of sickness and therefore, from the
> sanitary point of view, constitutes a serious danger;
> (d) it is almost impossible to control these people
> politically or militarily so that military spies from
> foreign countries and counter-revolutionary organisations
> could easily shelter among them.

By 1922 a bit under a third of these people would have
been deported. (G 36)


### Investigation

Tukhachevsky, albeit not involved in political suppression, 
was not easy on the rebels either.
Before the second attack Tukhachevsky ordered the 
'shooting of rebels without pity', adding 'prisoners are
not to be taken'; then, in another order, he demanded 
clemency towards Kronstaders who would turn sides. 
(It is hard to tell what was the actual effect these orders 
had on the front line battle.) (C 36-8)
Notoriously, Tukhachevsky was also ready to use 
poisonous gas against the main Kronstadt battleships, 
although this measure was rendered unnecessary by the 
crew's surrender. (The crew feared that the Red Army 
would sank their ships.) (C 37-38)
And yet, Tukhachevsky remarked 15 years later that 
the human toll could have been avoided, suggesting 
that the conflict could have been solved by negotiation 
rather than threats (C 16-7):

> To me, it seems it was possible to avoid bloodshed, at the 
> very least to end it all sooner, at the very start of the 
> revolt. But the Petrograd Committee of Defence thought it 
> could cope with it with the forces it had. Besides its
> tactless appeal, [it issued] vulgar threats to the rebels: 
> ‘If you resist, you will be shot like partridges ...’ Because 
> of this were suffered such wretched losses of people ... and 
> of such people. Many mobilised delegates of the 10th Congress 
> were killed or wounded. They went in great numbers. Of course,
> this inspired the Red Army men, but at what price ...?
> Nevertheless Kronstadt for me was unexpected. The fortress of
> the Revolution ... a terrible affair!

Amid the generalized political turmoil, it was not a Bolshevik 
instinct to give voice and listen to their opponents. 
The Kronstadt sailors were treated on a par with the White 
armies of the civil war. No real negotiation was attempted. 
On the contrary, Trotsky and his collaborators opposed 
having any person sympathetic to the sailors in the commission 
investigating the causes of the rebellion. At the beginning
of March, an alternative to the Troika was still on the table 
for the purposes of investigating Kronstadt. The alternative 
was  a five-man body, a *Piaterka*. The Piaterka, it was suggested,
should have included Nikolai Kamarov, the chairman of the Petrograd 
Cheka and Zinoviev's protégé. But other Bolsheviks did not
trust Kamarov. On March 8, Trotsky sent Menzhinsky -- the head of
the Secret Section of Cheka -- a report concerning Kamarov.
(The report was put together by Vasily Sevei, Plenipotentiary of
the Special Section of the Cheka, the eager mastermind of the 
competing Troika.)

> I report that according to absolutely trustworthy
> information in my possession, the chairman of the
> Petrograd Cheka, comrade Komarov, regards the 
> Kronstadt events as a spontaneous movement and is 
> in full solidarity with [the Menshevik Fiodor] Dan 
> as to its causes. In this situation, Moscow's 
> insistence on Komarov's participation and even
> chairmanship of the piaterka will guarantee that 
> the piaterka will be still-born and will reduce all 
> our initiatives to nothing.

Moreover, on March 9, in a cable to Skliansky with a copy to 
Menzhinsky, Trotsky reiterated Sevei's concerns and
added that their task is not only to search for White
Guardists and SRs but also to remove any unsuitable
Kronstadt leaders. He also decided, in the end, not
to form a special commission of investigation. The
historian Israel Getzler sees in this decision Trotsky's 
intention of purging the political leadership of the 
Baltic Fleet, which would soon become reality (p.34)

And yet we have one reliable source to determine the 
nature of the Kronstadt uprising.
The Cheka head Felix Dzerzhinsky sent Iakov Agranov -- 
an experienced Cheka agent who was later to become one 
of the secret service's leaders -- to investigate the 
causes of the Kronstadt revolt that had just been 
subdued. 
On April 5, 1921 Agranov finished his secret report.
By drawing on this report, we can produce a crucial 
piece of evidence that no counter-revolutionary forces 
(such as White generals or *entente* agents) were 
responsible for the Kronstandt rebellion. 
Indeed Agranov argued in his report that:

> [the] uprising was entirely spontaneous in origin and drew into its
> maelstrom almost the entire population and the garrison of the
> fortress. With the formation of the Revolutionary Committee,
> and, generally, thanks to the concentration of military operations
> in the hands of the staff of the fortress, the uprising came to
> assume a planned character, under the command of the old
> officers' corps. But the investigation failed to show the outbreak
> of the mutiny was preceded by the activity of any counter-
> revolutionary organisation at work among the fortress's
> command or that it was the work of agents of the *entente*. The
> entire course of the movement speaks against that possibility.
> Had the mutiny been the work of some secret organisation which
> predated its outbreak, then that organisation would not have
> planned it for a time when the reserves of fuel and provisions
> were hardly sufficient for two weeks and when the thawing of
> the ice was still far off.

Moreover, Agranov pointed out, the appeals made by the soviet 
government -- one such appeal was signed by Lenin and Trotsky 
on March 2 -- which blamed the uprising on "the agents of the 
entente and on General Alexander Kozlovskii, had only served 
to anger Kronstadt's sailors and workers". 

What's remarkable about this document is the stark departure of Agranov's 
findings from the official Soviet line -- that Trotsky would still echo in his 1939
[essay](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/01/kronstadt.htm) --
which constantly depicted the uprising as the did of agents provocateurs
and other counter-revolutionary forces.
If Agranov didn't take the easy way out by adopting the party line, 
this must have been because all the evidence pointed to the contrary.
In the end, no checkist was able to find any trace of 
substantial outside involvement in the Kronstadt uprising. Eye 
witnesses testified to the spontaneity of the revolt. (G 26-27)


### Propaganda

On May 16 the Communist leadership proceeded to remove
all traces of the revolt. An order was addressed to the
military commands to 'confiscate all publications of the
Kronstadt Revolutionary Committee ... and to send all
confiscated literature to the Political Sections'. The
local paper, *Izvestiia* was renamed *Krasnyi Kronshta*, the
Petrovpavlovsk became the Marat, the Anchor Square was
renamed Revolution Square, and, ironically, the Sevastopol
became the Paris Commune. (G 38)

Propaganda was pressed into service. Krupaskaia proposed 
on March 22 the
publication of a popular 'Red Book of Kronstadt' with
factual materials selected by the Cheka and the Central
Committee of the Party in order to 'to elucidate events,
the internal groupings, the foreign links, the internal 
developments that marked the internal collapse'. Trotsky
had a more ambitious idea: 'a Political [Show] Trial of Kronstadters 
and Makhnovites'. 'With the help of the relevant materials', 
Trotsky said, 'one could give extra significance to the 
trial'. This is because the 'effect of the reports and the
speeches of the prosecutor etcetera would be far more 
powerful than the effect of brochures and leaflets about the
Eserovshchina [Kronstadt] and anarchists [Makhnovites]'.
(G 38-9)

In the end, nothing came of these proposals, but it is
interesting to note that scripts for the trials were
already being prepared in which, e.g., one of the Kronstadt 
protagonists, Kozlovsky, presents himself as a tsarist linked
to foreign circles in Western Europe. The script had him
avow that he'd looked for SR, Menshevik and Anarchist assistance, 
at least until foreign help would come to the rescue. 
Similar 'testimonies' were
written for two other Kronstadt leaders, Stepan Petrichenko and
Sergei Putilin. But the three couldn't be cast in any show trial,
for they escaped to Finland. (G 39-40)

It is telling that none of the condemning accounts of
the Kronstadt mutiny came to fruition. A commission for
the study of the Kronstadt events was cancelled a few
days after being set up, and the assignment given by the
Politburo to Zinoviev, Radek and Vatslav Vorovsky to write
brochures about the events produced only one borchure, by
Radek, and only under the pressure of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party. (G 41)

### Moral judgements

There is still room for moral debate as to the Bolshevik
conduct regarding Kronstadt. Bolsheviks had lofty goals which
a bunch of idealists threatened to thwart. On the other hand
the Bolsheviks attempted no serious negotiation and offered no
chance of a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
From an anarchist perspective and, more generally, from the
perspective of anyone upholding democratic principles even 
in the face of most tense political situations, this is already 
damning; the Bolsheviks had power and misused it at the expense of a 
minority going through the motions of a legitimate protest.
But then you have the pragmatists: yes, the naive Kronstaders
fell in between two larger schemes, but the soviets were not 
supposed to play with the most decisive political change of 
the twentieth century for the sake of a minority, however 
well-intentioned that minority might have been.
My moral judgements go with the anarchists and democrats. 
But let's suspend judgement on this issue
Irrespective of whether suppression was or not the least bad 
solution, we have clear evidence for the innocence of 
Kronstadt.[^moral-detail] 

[^morall-detail]: 
Note that moral innocence and moral value are here judged in a 
narrow way, according to how well a political or military act
(to be morally evaluated) matches the aspirations of the revolution. 
Had we not assumed from the outset that revolution is morally good, 
the Kronstadters would be unimpeachable, since, of course, in a 
set-up where the political choices are not limited to (soviet-style) 
socialist parties, one has the right to choose -- or fight on the 
side of -- any side one deems best, be it a monarchy, a right-wing 
party or a parliamentary democracy bringing together a plurality of
interests; if we broadened our moral horizon in this way, the
Kronstadters alleged collaboration with Whites or with the entente 
would pose no problem, since they would be doing what the Bosheviks
had already done, that is, trying to take power on behalf of the 
political option one considers best. But we stick to a narrower, 
soviet-friendly, moral question: did the people of Kronstadt 
associate with external forces in order to put an end to the 
revolution, thus endangering such revolutionary principles as all 
the power to the soviets, no exploitation, no capitalist-interest
with political representation? I think the answer is no.

As Isaac Deutscher remarked about the Bolshevik denunciation of 
Kronstaders -- which imputed them counter-revolutionary actions 
in collusion with a White general -- the "denunciation appears 
to have been groundless".
This remark, which was made more than half a century ago, seems 
to be accepted by most historians of the Russian revolution, and 
it is certainly true on the evidence I marshalled in this essay.


Yet, if the Bolsheviks had not managed to document a condemnation
of Kronstadt while they were in power, it appears that 
some more recent authors have done the job for them.
Indeed one can find online a couple of denunciations 
complete with Bolshevik rhetoric and a bibliography
citing documents from the newly released Russian archives. 
Needless to say, such positions -- seeking to vindicate, 
against all odds, both Trotsky's and (perhaps) Lenin's views of 
Kronstadt as counter-revolutionary -- are in a tiny minority 
within an already tiny minority of people interested in the 
events surrounding the Kronstadt rebellion.

Although one can find some intriguing bits of information 
in such revisionist accounts, their entire narrative is less
than convincing.
This narrative fails on two important counts.
First, any accusation of a rebellion carefully prepared by
the Whites or a Western agency has to contend with the fact 
that the sailors' rebellion broke out at a time when Kronstadt
was most vulnerable to Red Army attacks (their supplies were 
scarce and the Red Army's access to the island was facilitated 
by the frozen waters). 
Second, one cannot just pick incriminating quotations from 
the Russian archives and take them at face value. After all 
those are the victors' archives, brimming with self-justifying 
documents and including testimonies given to the secret police 
under threat of violence.
So far I have not seen these two concerns properly addressed 
in Leninist and Totskyist pieces trying to change our minds about
Kronstadt, so I'll stand by my conclusion that the people of
Kronstadt died innocent and with legitimate aspirations in mind.
